## Working with git

### Github Solvro Handbook üî•

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sb5lYqYLnYuecS1Essn3YwietsbuLPCTsTuW0EMpG5o/edit?usp=sharing

### SSH

Connecting to Github(Gh) repository via SSH on Windows, tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vExsOTgIOGw

### Building new feature

1. git checkout main -> checkout main branch
2. git pull origin main -> pull current changes from main branch
3. git fetch -> be up to date with remote branches
4. git checkout -b WEB-x_my_feature_branch -> x - stands for issue number; it is going to checkout and create new branch name WEB-x_my_feature_branch
   (... working on the feature, we are still on our branch named WEB-x_my_feature_branch)
5. git add . -> add all changes we have made
6. git commit -m "My changes description" -> commit made changes with proper description
7. git push origin WEB-x_my_feature_branch -> pushing our changes to remote branch
8. On Github we are going to make Pull Request (PR) from our remote branch

### Remarks

- Do not push directly to main branch!!! This is bad practice!
- local branch - is our branch on our computer not on the server if we do some chagnes and do checkout to diffrent branch without saving them(commiting) we might loose them, commit before checkout to different branch!
- remote branch - this is branch with our code in github's servers
- After code review which was successful, we can merge from our feature branch to main branch. After merging we should clean after ourself.

1. git branch -d WEB-x_my_feature_branch -> deletes our local branch
2. git push origin --delete WEB-x_my_feature_branch -> delete our remote branch

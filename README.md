## Deployment

[Coolify](https://coolify.io/) - An online platform offering the ability to host your own web applications, similar to Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel, but open-source and self-hostable on your own server.

Currently, the site is hosted on a VPS from the IT Department, and it must be renewed every year. For access to Coolify, you should contact @Rei-x, @dawidlinek, @Szymczek, or @karbowskijakub.

Coolify address: https://devops.solvro.pl

For each pull request, a Preview Deployment is automatically created, and Coolify adds a comment with a link to this version.

Everything on the main branch is automatically deployed to production.

## CMS

We use [Directus CMS](https://directus.io/), available at https://cms.solvro.pl. For access, request the same people responsible for access to Coolify.

All content is fetched during the build process, and to update things on the site, you need to update them in the CMS and wait for the site to rebuild (this happens automatically as Directus is connected to a webhook in Coolify). You can monitor this in the Deployments tab in Coolify.

## Analytics

We have analytics set up at https://analytics.solvro.pl
